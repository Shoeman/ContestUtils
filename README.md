# ContestUtils
Utilities to aid in building BAMZOOKi contests programatically

The basis of this is the [Agent](data/Agent.py) class, a representation of agents in contest files which allows you to manipulate the "params" in the form of a dictionary.

## TODO

- Define and parse behaviours
- Nice factory/builders to create agents without parsing
